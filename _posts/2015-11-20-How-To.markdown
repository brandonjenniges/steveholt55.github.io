Wage Calculator is the first application I ever published on either Android or iOS. I created it after taking my first programming class in college. I made this app because I always wanted to know how much money I was making while doing certain tasks at work. Although the app is very simple I have made an effort to continually update it both from a UI perspective and with the code.
