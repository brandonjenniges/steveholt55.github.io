This is the first and only game I have created from start to finish.  I initially released it for Android a few years ago using AndEngine and later on iOS using SpriteKit.  I decided to later combine the code into a single code base using SpriteBuilder and Cocos2D.  Making mobile games is a huge passion of mine and I can't wait to make another game.
