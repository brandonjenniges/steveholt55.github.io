A football trivia game written in Swift for iOS and Java for Android.  I made this app because I've always been a huge sports fan and enjoy testing my knowledge.  This app has a main focus of testing users to see if they know what college their favorite NFL players attended.  I used rosters from EA's Madden NFL series to generate the questions and difficulties for the app.
